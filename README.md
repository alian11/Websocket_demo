# Websocket_demo
Welcome to my Websocket_demo. 
Platform: vscode.
Execuated documents:Server:app.js
                    Client:index.html
Step 1:In this demo,I use node.js to create personal server.So please download nodejs fristly.
       Node.js url:https://nodejs.org/en/download/
       In my device. I choose version : windows installer(.msi) 64-bit
Step 2:You could choose npm install some packages. But i suggest you to use yarn way.
       You could access to your cmd with admin right.And execuate "npm install yarn" 
Step 3:Thanks for open source nodejs-websocket from sitegui.
       This is it's github url :https://github.com/sitegui/nodejs-websocket
       Your could just execuate:(1)npm install nodejs-websocket (2) yarn add nodejs-websocket(I use this method)
       Of course, In this demo. I have import that package and use it in my app.js
Step 4:You should firstly run the app.js to start the websocket server.In my demo, I set the port as 3001.You could change it with your local personal ip address.

       And you could open the index.html in your laptop brower or any device like your smartphone to be a client.But these devices should be in same local network.
